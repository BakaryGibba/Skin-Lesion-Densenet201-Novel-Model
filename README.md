# DenseNet201-SE with Explainable AI for Skin Lesion Classification

This repository presents a deep learning model developed as part of a research study titled:

**"Skin Lesion Classification with Explainable AI to Enhance Dermatological Diagnosis"**

The work integrates **DenseNet201 with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks** and employs **Explainable AI (XAI)** techniques to classify skin lesions from MRI images. The model is trained and evaluated on the [PH² Skin Cancer MRI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashidul0/ph2-skin-cancer-classification), targeting more transparent and accurate clinical decision support.

## 🧠 Overview of the Model

Our architecture is grounded in **DenseNet201**, known for its efficient feature reuse and gradient flow. To improve discriminative ability, we embedded **SE blocks** that perform dynamic channel-wise feature recalibration, strengthening the network’s attention to informative features while suppressing noise.

The model architecture is enhanced further with **Explainable AI methods** such as Grad-CAM to visualize and understand the regions influencing model predictions. This promotes transparency and increases trustworthiness in clinical applications.

## 📊 Model Performance

After training on the PH² dataset and validating with a held-out test set of 440 samples, the model achieved the following results:

```

```
          precision    recall  f1-score   support

 Class 0       0.86      0.92      0.89       181
 Class 1       0.92      0.85      0.89       169
 Class 2       0.98      0.98      0.98        90

accuracy                           0.91       440
```

macro avg       0.92      0.92      0.92       440
weighted avg       0.91      0.91      0.91       440

````

These results suggest strong generalization and reliability across all lesion types.

## 📂 Dataset Used

We utilize the **PH² Skin Lesion MRI Dataset**, which contains annotated dermatological images from clinical cases:

📌 [PH² Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashidul0/ph2-skin-cancer-classification)

All images were resized, normalized, and augmented before feeding into the model.
